Budget 2023 Personal Income Tax: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman should revise income tax rates or
income tax slabs in Union Budget 2023, says an online TOI-Deloitte survey. Almost 85% of respondents in the pre-Budget survey said 
that the top tax priority for the common man should be reduction in the income tax burden.There has been no change in 
the individual tax rates since 2017-18. While the simplified personal tax regime was introduced effective FY 2020-21,
the tax rate did not undergo a change. Asked about the top income tax relief measures that the government can take, 
most participants said that revising income tax slabs with the 30% tax slab at income of above Rs 20 lakh (as against current Rs 10 Lakhs) 
should be considered in Union Budget 2023.The highest slab rate for an individual taxpayer is currently pegged at 42.744% which is
 significantly higher than the corporate tax rate of 25%. "Clearly there is a need to align the individual tax rates with corporate 
 tax rates. One may expect that the highest tax slab rates be reduced from 30% to 25% and/or the applicable slab for 30% tax rate 
 be increased from Rs 10,00,000 to Rs 20,00,000," says Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India.
